			<h3>Introduction</h3>
		FAO with OIE developed a fifteen-year strategy for the global control of FMD which was endorsed by over 100 countries at the global conference held in Bangkok in June 2012. The overall objective of the Global FMD Control Strategy is to contribute to poverty alleviation and improving the livelihoods in developing countries and to protect and further the global and regional trade in animals and animal products. The specific objective not only aims to reduce the burden of FMD on animal production in developing countries, but also in FMD-free countries. Reducing FMD at source in FMD-endemic countries is therefore a shared interest and should be considered a Global Public Good.
		        The strategy includes three components; (i) improving global FMD control, (ii) strengthening veterinary services and (iii) improving the prevention and control of other major diseases of livestock.
		
		
		Tools of importance for FMD prevention and control are:
		<ol>
		<li>The FMD Progressive Control Pathway (PCP-FMD) and regional roadmaps</li>
		<li>OIE standards, recognition of disease status and endorsement of control programmes</li>
		<li>Diagnostic laboratories, reference laboratories/centres, regional and global networks</li>
		<li>National, Provincial and local control plans and strategies</li>
		<li>Vaccines and vaccination procedures including logistics</li>
		<li>National, regional and international surveillance; epidemiology skills and networks</li>
		</ol>
		        In order to monitor the progress of FMD control since the development of the global strategy, we kindly ask you to fill out the enclosed questionnaire while focusing on activities carried out since 2012.  
		        Information gathered from this questionnaire will be formulated as a global report to be published and distributed to the FMD community electronically and hard copies.
		        The global report will elaborate on the following areas:
		FMD virus circulation and recent FMD reported events in 2013 and 2014.
		FMD control strategies used for implementation of control plans 
		Suitability of control initiatives and challenges in their implementation
		International and regional investments supporting FMD control
		State of FMD research in  2013 and 2014
